# Two Step Wizard Form

**`[React, Validation, Material UI]`**

This form allows the user to enter a set of requested data fields in a two step wizard. At the end of the user flow, the data should be sent to a REST API accepting JSON documents as the data body of a POST request. As there is no such api, the app simply collects the data and prints the JSON document to the browser js console.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

This project requires a server to start working.

- [View project online](https://frosty-colden-f63461.netlify.com/#/)

Please follow instructions below, if you are willing to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Both [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are required to run this project locally.

### Installing

Please copy and paste below commands to your Git terminal step by step to get a development env running.

Download a repository:

```node
git clone git@github.com:szympol/React_Router_Countries_List.git countriesListReactApp
```

Go to the project working directory:

```node
cd countriesListReactApp
```

Install all of the dependencies with the following command:

```node
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
